    content: "Worked on a full-stack DMRV (Digital Measurement, Reporting & Verification) system for biomass pyrolysis, supporting MRV compliance and carbon credit generation. Maintained a React Native mobile app with RESTful API integration for real-time field data collection (e.g., pyrolysis temperature, moisture %, biochar yield). Engineered scalable backend services using Node.js and JavaScript, with PostgreSQL, and containerized the stack with Docker for cross-environment consistency. Implemented robust data validation using Joi schemas to enforce input correctness and consistency, alongside verification pipelines ensuring cryptographic integrity and auditability aligned with carbon accounting frameworks. Contributed to system design for transforming agricultural waste into biochar, enabling long-term carbon sequestration and emissions reduction.",

    content: "Spearheaded the deployment of a gate control system utilizing MQTT Protocol for real-time device communication, integrating geofencing for enhanced security. Implemented a custom REST API with JWT authorization for secure access. Utilized React Native for frontend development, resulting in enhanced user interface and efficiency. Integrated MySQL with Sequelize ORM for robust database management. Key features: Seamless Device Communication (enabled real-time control and monitoring of gate systems through MQTT, providing reliable and low-latency device communication). Geolock (implemented geofencing to restrict access based on user location). Admin User Dashboard (designed an admin dashboard for managing users and system settings).",
